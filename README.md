# The so far: "MEN" Stack Project
***(Mongo, Express, & Node)***

A small practice project to increase my understanding of making applications using the following stack:
  - Mongo DB (A no-sql database)
  - Express.js (A node.js framework)
  - Node.js (A runtime enviroment)
 
This is the ground zero for adding and testing my knowledge of Node.js. The project is based off of [cwbuecheler]'s amazing, & informative tutorial. I highly recommend clicking his name and checking out his tutorial if interested in this stack.

Features I may be adding will be located in the [issues] tab. Feel free to submit issues and enhancements!
